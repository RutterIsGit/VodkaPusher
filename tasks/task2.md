# Task 2: Explore Google Knowledge Graph API

## Objective
Assess whether the Google Knowledge Graph Search API can be used to return a comprehensive list of pubs in Essex and create a test script to demonstrate its capabilities.

## Implementation Plan

### [x] 1. Research Google Knowledge Graph API
- [x] Review Google Knowledge Graph Search API documentation
- [x] Understand API capabilities and limitations
- [x] Check rate limits and pricing
- [x] Identify required API credentials and setup process

### [x] 2. API Setup
- [x] Create/verify Google Cloud Project
- [x] Enable Knowledge Graph Search API
- [x] Generate API credentials
- [x] Document credential setup process for team

### [x] 3. Create Test Script Structure
- [x] Create `test_knowledge_graph.py` script
- [x] Implement basic API client setup
- [x] Add configuration for API key management (use .env file)
- [x] Implement error handling for API responses

### [x] 4. Implement Search Queries
- [x] Test basic entity search for "pubs"
- [x] Experiment with location-based queries:
  - "pubs in Essex"
  - "pubs in Essex UK"
  - "public houses Essex England"
- [x] Try different entity types:
  - `Organization`
  - `LocalBusiness`
  - `BarOrPub`
  - `Restaurant` (some pubs may be categorized this way)

### [x] 5. Explore Query Parameters
- [x] Test with different parameters:
  - `limit`: Maximum results per query
  - `types`: Filter by entity types
  - `prefix`: For autocomplete-style searches
- [x] Experiment with geographic bounding:
  - Check if API supports location radius
  - Test with Essex coordinates/boundaries

### [x] 6. Analyze Results Quality
- [x] Document what information is returned for each pub:
  - Name
  - Address
  - Phone number
  - Website
  - Opening hours
  - Reviews/ratings
- [x] Compare results with existing OSM data
- [x] Assess coverage (how many Essex pubs are found?)
- [x] Check data accuracy and freshness

### [x] 7. Implement Pagination
- [x] Handle API pagination if available
- [x] Implement logic to retrieve all results
- [x] Add progress tracking for large result sets

### [x] 8. Create Comparison Report
- [x] Generate CSV output of Knowledge Graph results
- [x] Compare with current OSM-based approach:
  - Number of venues found
  - Data completeness
  - Data quality
  - Geographic coverage
- [x] Document pros and cons of each approach

### [x] 9. Performance and Cost Analysis
- [x] Measure API response times
- [x] Calculate API costs for full Essex coverage
- [x] Compare with current Google Search API costs
- [x] Document rate limiting considerations

## Test Script Requirements
```python
# test_knowledge_graph.py structure
- Configuration loading from .env
- API client initialization
- Multiple search query examples
- Result parsing and normalization
- CSV export functionality
- Comparison with existing data
- Performance metrics logging
- Cost estimation output
```

## Success Criteria
- Working test script that queries Knowledge Graph API
- Clear understanding of API capabilities for pub discovery
- Comprehensive comparison with OSM approach
- Recommendation on whether to integrate Knowledge Graph API
- Documentation of findings in `docs/knowledge_graph_analysis.md`
