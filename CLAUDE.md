1. Please every step of the way just give me a high level explanation of what changes you made
2. Make every task and code change you do as simple as possible. We want to avoid making anything more complex then it needs to be. Every change should impact as little code as possible. Everything is about simplicity.
3. If a test fails, do not modify the test without reason to believe the test is faulty, write code to pass tests.
